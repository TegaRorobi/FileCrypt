**Important things to setup from the onset**
- Setting up a testing suite for the endpoints and services.
- Making use of github workflows to run these on the remote server upon merging pull requests or push actions.

> In the README file, there was something about the architecture for the project.

***Learn about the various architectures available and exactly what the one mentioned in the README implies.***

- Keep a neat and consistent folder structure throughout the entirety of this project.

- Also make sure to not make the committing process nuanced.

Write out the apps to be created and draw out the schema before even typing a line of code.



Install Django and the initial requirements.
Create a new project, and the neccessary apps.
Configure the settings.
Configure Django REST Framework.
Incorporate swagger UI and mod the necessary settings.
Create the schema.
Start with the basic endpoints.
Add authentication and authorization.
Add permissions to these endpoints.
Workout the main encryption algorithm.


## The whole point of teams, workspaces and all is sort of a role based access control for which set of people can view certain files and folders.


The encryption key is generated by the backend. Users can choose to get this encryption key either by email or by text message.

For added security, even if an encryption key is stolen, the encryption key would be configured not to work on other accounts, except the ones selected by the holder of the encryption key. So, if they share the encryption key with another account, they would have to select that account as one of the accounts to be able to use the encryption key. (This functionality could be made optional, if they don't want to have to do this anytime they share.)

## Apps that this project should have:

1. the monolithic 'main' app
2. a 'users' app for anything involving users (which might be inherited from in the main app to add useful methods and functionality for the businesses, organisations, teams, etc.)
3. another 'notifications' app for notifications, emails, text messages, etc.
4. 


## Functionality

### Single user account

- Signup
- Have an interface to access their encrypted resources (their name tags would be there, and the type of the resource, whether it's a folder, image, text, etcetera)
- Encrypt a resource which they upload.
- Get the encryption key for that resource (the encryption keys are saved for the user account and they can recover the encryptionkey for any resource in case they lost it.)
- They can send this encryption key to someone else, and they should be able to view the file(s) without having to sign up on the platform.
- The person sharing a resource should provide a link to the resource (available on the dashboard) and then the key. When the viewer clicks on the link, they have to then enter the key to have access to the resource.
